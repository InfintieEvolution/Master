    abstract="Designing island models is a challenging task for researchers. A number of decisions is required regarding the structure of the islands, how they are connected, how many individuals are migrated, which ones and how often. The impact of these choices is yet to be fully understood, specially since it may change between different problems and contexts. Cluster geometry optimization is a widely known and complex problem that provides a set of hard instances to assess and test optimization algorithms. The analysis presented in this paper reveals how design options for island models impact search effectiveness and population diversity, when seeking for the global optima of short-ranged Morse clusters. These outcomes support the definition of a robust and scalable island-based framework for cluster geometry optimization problems.",

We propose that this dichotomy is somewhat to blame for the lack of significant advancement of the field in either direction and demonstrate how a simplistic interpretation of Perelson's shape-space formalism may have largely contributed to this dichotomy. In this paper, we motivate and derive an alternative representational abstraction. To do so we consider the validity of shape-space from both the biological and machine learning perspectives. We then take steps towards formally integrating these perspectives into a coherent computational model of notions such as life-long learning, degeneracy, constructive representations and contextual recognition---rhetoric that has long inspired work in AIS, while remaining largely devoid of operational definition.",

Its name stems from Vote-ALlocating Immune System, as it evolves a population of artificial antibodies that can bind to the input data, and performs classification through a voting process. In the beginning of the training, VALIS generates a set of random candidate antibodies; at each iteration, it selects the most useful ones to produce new candidates, while the least, are discarded; the process is iterated until a user-defined stopping condition. The paradigm allows the user to get a visual insight of the learning dynamics, helping to supervise the process, pinpoint problems, and tweak feature engineering. VALIS is tested against nine state-of-the-art classification algorithms on six popular benchmark problems; results demonstrate that it is competitive with well-established black-box techniques, and superior in specific corner cases.",

Responding to these challenges, distributed evolutionary computation has received considerable attention over the past decade. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art distributed evolutionary algorithms and models, which have been classified into two groups according to their task division mechanism. Population-distributed models are presented with master-slave, island, cellular, hierarchical, and pool architectures, which parallelize an evolution task at population, individual, or operation levels. Dimension-distributed models include coevolution and multi-agent models, which focus on dimension reduction. Insights into the models, such as synchronization, homogeneity, communication, topology, speedup, advantages and disadvantages are also presented and discussed. The study of these models helps guide future development of different and/or improved algorithms. Also highlighted are recent hotspots in this area, including the cloud and MapReduce-based implementations, GPU and CUDA-based implementations, distributed evolutionary multiobjective optimization, and real-world applications. Further, a number of future research directions have been discussed, with a conclusion that the development of distributed evolutionary computation will continue to flourish."

GA also thrives into many variations of models and approaches. Multi-population or island model GA (IMGA) is one of the commonly used GA models. IMGA is a multi-population GA model objected to getting a better result (aimed to get global optimum) by intrinsically preserve its diversity. Localization strategy of IMGA is a new approach which sees an island as a single living environment for its individuals. An island's characteristic must be different compared to other islands. Operator parameter configuration or even its core engine (algorithm) represents the nature of an island. These differences will incline into different evolution tracks which can be its speed or pattern. Localization strategy for IMGA uses three kinds of single GA core: standard GA, pseudo GA, and informed GA. Localization strategy implements migration protocol and the bias value to control the movement. The experiment results showed that localization strategy for IMGA succeeds to solve 3-SAT with an excellent performance. This brand new approach is also proven to have a high consistency and durability.",

We design a scheduling method based on Single Genetic Algorithm (SGA) and Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA). In the scheduling method, the representation, which encodes the job number, is made to be always feasible, the initial population is generated through integrating representation and G&T algorithm, the new genetic operators and selection method are designed to better transmit the temporal relationships in the chromosome, and island model PGA are proposed. The scheduling methods based on genetic algorithm are tested on five standard benchmark JSSP. The results are compared with other proposed approaches. Compared to traditional genetic algorithm, the proposed approach yields significant improvement in solution quality. The superior results indicate the successful incorporation of a method to generate initial population into the genetic operators."

In this paper, a new hybrid parallel GA (PGA) based on a combination of asynchronous colony GA (ACGA) and autonomous immigration GA (AIGA) is employed to solve benchmark job shop scheduling problem. An autonomous function of sharing the best solution across the system is enabled through the implementation of a migration operator and a “global mailbox”. The solution is able to minimize the makespan of the scheduling problem, as well as reduce the computation time. To further improve the computation time, micro GA which works on small population is used in this approach. The result shows that the algorithm is able to decrease the makespan considerably as compared to the conventional GA."

abstract="The purpose of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, it aims to demonstrate empirically that networks evolved using different shaped recognition regions in a real-valued shape-space exhibit different dynamics during their formation, and vary in both their capabilities to tolerate antigens and in their memory capacity. Secondly, the paper serves as a useful comparison to previous published work which investigated the properties of a network evolving in a simple, small Hamming shape-space. This work represents the first steps in a proper analysis of a real-valued shape-space with differing recognition shapes. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments presented illustrate the importance of paying careful attention to the choice of recognition region and algorithm parameters when applying an AIS based on a network-model to practical problems.",

abstract = "Using different shapes of recognition regions in Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are not a new issue. Especially, ellipsoidal shapes seem to be more intriguing as they have also been used very effectively in other shape space-based classification methods. Some studies have done in AIS through generating ellipsoidal detectors but they are restricted in their detector generating scheme – Genetic Algorithms (GA). In this study, an AIS was developed with ellipsoidal recognition regions by inspiring from the clonal selection principle and an effective search procedure for ellipsoidal regions was applied. Performance evaluation tests were conducted as well as application results on some real-world classification problems taken from UCI machine learning repository were obtained. Comparison with GA was also done in some of these problems. Very effective and comparatively good classification ratios were recorded."

abstract="The biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or molecules) within the body as self-cells or nonself cells. It does this with the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in recent years.",
